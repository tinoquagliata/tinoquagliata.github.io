				<p>Hi! My name is Tino Quagliata and I am a junior journalism at the University of Maryland. I was born in St. Helena, California but I grew up in Verona, New Jersey! I am a sports fanatic and I hope to turn that passion into a career. Since arriving on campus, I have immersed myself in several different sports media mediums. First semester freshman year, I got involved with the <a href="https://twitter.com/TheLeftBench">Left Bench TV</a> and continue to work with them to this day. The Left Bench is a student-run sports show that covers every UMD team. We put together packages of every home game, make feature videos, and produce a 15-20 minute show every other week. At the start of sophomore year, I started working with <a href="https://btn.com/about/student-u/">Big Ten Student U</a>. Student U is a paid job where we put together live broadcasts of several different sports on campus that can be streamed on BTN+. I have worked camera, replay, TD, graphics, and scoreboard with Big Ten Student U.</p>
				<p>A little bit more about myself: I am a Yankees, Knicks, and New York Giants fan. But, my love for the Yankees trumps the rest because of my affinity for baseball. I would also consider myself a major foodie. My father was a chef and remains in the restaurant business so that is where I get it from. My favorite food is pasta but I am down to try almost anything. I love hip-hop. My favorite rappers/groups are Kanye West, Jay-Z, Migos, Young Thug, and Travis Scott. If I am not doing work, watching sports, or listening to music, I'm probably watching a show. Some of my favorite shows are The Office, Big Mouth, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, and Succession. Now that you know a little about me, check out my resume to learn some more about what I have done!</p>
