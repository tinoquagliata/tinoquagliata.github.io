	<p>In his senior year of high school, DJ LeMahieu entered a milk chugging contest. His all-boys high school in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., had organized a tournament in which students from each grade would compete against one another in a series of challenges. They could sign up for a basketball tournament, a wiffle ball home run derby, a flag football match and other various events.</p>
	<h2>Milk</h2>

<p>LeMahieu likely would have dominated any of the sports-related competitions he would have entered. He was a skilled baseball and basketball player, and his natural athleticism and determination seemed to allow him to excel at whichever competition he tried.</p>

<p>“He knew if he played a basketball game in front of the whole school or if he went out and played football, he would win all of it. There was a home run derby for wiffleball and everyone said, ‘Oh, DJ is gonna hit like 60 bombs,’ and he didn’t sign up for it,” said Brad Galli, a close friend of LeMahieu’s from Michigan. ”I’m pretty sure milk was the only thing that he wanted to do that day, and he devoted all his effort into doing it.”</p>

<p>So, when he was given his options his senior year — the sports he was already known to be good at, or a new challenge that could probably contribute more win probability for the senior boys — he chose the chugging.</p>
